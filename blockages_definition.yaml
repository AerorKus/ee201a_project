# this YAML file contains the definition of the blockages for the project
# you need to populate this file and feed it to the bounds checker to ensure your blockages have been honoured by Innovus.
# we will use this file and the bounds checker to verify your blockages.
# We recommend you find a way to automatically generate this file as part of your workflow.
# You can then use the bounds checker to verify your blockages at any time as part of your search space exploration.

# the blockages are defined as a list of dictionaries, each dictionary contains the following keys:
# - x1: the x1 coordinate of the blockage
# - y1: the y1 coordinate of the blockage
# - x2: the x2 coordinate of the blockage
# - y2: the y2 coordinate of the blockage
# example blockage listed below. You should replace these coordinates with the ones you are using.

        "x2": 11,
        "y2": 24
